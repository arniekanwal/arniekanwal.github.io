I graduated from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in December '23, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Hubbell, where I develop systems-level C/C++ code for teleprotection products (embedded linux target). I work across the entire application-stack from fullstack development for the embedded webserver, networking, or interfacing with Linux kernel APIs or device driver APIs. Before this, I worked as a lead developer and researcher at NYU's High Speed Network where I had the opportunity to lead a team of undergraduates in developing dashboard apps for the lab.  


My technical interests are now leaning towards Infra/backend engineering and ML. I'm fresh onto the tech scene and endlessly curious about the climate and direction of this field and the mechanisms behind growth and innovation.
