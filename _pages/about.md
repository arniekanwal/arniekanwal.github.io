I graduated from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in December '23, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Hubbell Incorporated, where I develop and maintain code for SCADA-compliant teleprotection devices. These products serve as network accessible nodes in the Power/Utilities space to protect, monitor, and connect devices across the grid. Before this, I worked as a lead developer at NYU's High Speed Research Network lab, leading a group of students in the design and creation of dashboard applications to manage equipment and network resources for parterning researchers and labs. 

My technical interests and background is currently in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing/Infrastructure, and Systems Engineering. Beyond this, I'm an avid runner, podcast bro, and incredibly curious about the world and the mechanisms behind innovation and radical progress.
