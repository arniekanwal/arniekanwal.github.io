I graduated from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in December '23, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Hubbell Incorporated, where I contribute the development and maintenance of embedded firmware for SCADA-compliant teleprotection devices. For those unfamiliar with these terms, these are products which serve Utility/Power companies in protecting critical grid infrastructure, and providing network accessible methods for monitoring and communicating with other devices across the grid.

I previously interned at this company where I had the opportunity to delve in systems engineering and simulataneously develop a robust software test framework for a select few products which only had manual testing in place. Beyond this, I also spent some time as a developer for NYU's High Speed Research Network, where I lead a team of web developers in the architecting and building dashboard applications to manage resource infrastructure and perform administration of equipment/network resources for parterning labs. 

My technical interests are focused around Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing/Infrastructure, and Systems Engineering. Beyond this, I'm an avid runner and intrigured about the randomness of our world, leading me down several rabbit holes on exploring the literature of Macroeconomics, Finance, and Politics.
