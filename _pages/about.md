I'm an undergraduate student at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering pursuing a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

My technical interests are in backend development, cloud computing, and embedded systems. I recently completed an internship as a software engineer
at Hubbell where I worked on embedded development of teleprotection products sold to utility companies. I also developed an on-target testing library in C/C++ on top of an open-source testing framework to create regression and unit tests for hardware I/O, an embedded Web GUI, and modular card configurations/settings.

I also work as an undergraduate developer at NYU's High Speed Research Network where I currently manage the web-applications development team and work on general applications for an open-source realtime data-streaming software called Corelink.
