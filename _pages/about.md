I graduated from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering in December '23, receiving a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics. 

I currently work as a Software Engineer at Hubbell, where I develop systems-level C/C++ code for teleprotection products on embedded linux targets. Due to the small team size, I get to work across the entire stack from fullstack integration with an embedded webserver, interfacing with Linux kernel APIs, system integration, and networking and linux configuration. Before this, I worked as a researcher and developer at NYU's High Speed Research Network where I led a team of students in developing fullstack dashboards to manage our lab's infrastructure.

My technical interests have been swaying recently, and am looking to transition to building scalable backends/infra and ML engineering. Iâ€™m fresh onto the tech scene and endlessly curious about the climate and direction of this field and the mechanisms behind growth and innovation.
